# Overview

Shuffle's pricing is primarily based on two things:
1. License - Based on App-Runs.
2. Support - Based on Post-Onboarding Needs.

We also have [training](https://shuffler.io/training) and [professional services](https://shuffler.io/professional-services), but they are optional and available if you need them.

## What are App-Runs?

App-runs are the actual app actions that run inside your workflow. They are a simple, direct, and transparent way to track the usage of the platform.

Take for example the workflow below. The workflow has many nodes, or as we call them, app actions. Whenever a workflow runs, the app actions that are executed are counted as app-runs.

'Only' the app actions that execute inside a workflow are counted as app-runs; the rest are ignored and not counted. In the workflow below, even though the workflow has many app actions, if the workflow stops at the (red) filter app action, only 4 app-runs are counted.
