## âœ… Important updates
- New Branding control, including light mode and button removal for Integration Partners

- We fixed the image saving and download problem for onprem Backend -> Orborus
- Orborus "Running" status on the frontend should now be more accurate, timing out after 120 seconds
- Ensured Certificate and other [volume mounts into Apps](https://shuffler.io/docs/configuration) now work as they should, whether read-write or not
- [New and easier to understand Pricing](https://shuffler.io/pricing)!

## ðŸš€ Features
- Made the first version of AI-Agent now work with your own LLM provider. This makes it possible for full open source deployments.

- Optimized how images are uploaded/downloaded from the cloud.
- Added better control of Workflow comments, text location and sizing.
- Made sure Orborus checks in more often, and doesn't get network congested as much
- Auto-scale mechanisms for Orborus have been improved

## ðŸª² Bug Fixes
- Allowed Notification Workflow bypass to properly track notifications even with network failures.
- Made failover search for workflows in other regions possible, as to handle public workflows.
- Minor cryptographic library update for all apps. This makes Liquid work better.
- Reduced Singul's dependency on AI and increased schemaless reliability.
- Forms are now better to use for User Input mechanisms
- Fixed a problem with duplicate Shuffle Datastore categories
