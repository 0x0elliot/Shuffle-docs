## Introduction
The Shuffle ecosystem is built on open source code, and since the start, we've focused on openness and building as good a service as we can. We do however know that we don't know everything, and need help from the community to create as good of a service for our customers as possible. That's why we've launched the creator program - a way we can share revenue with everyone who spend time helping Shuffle grow by creating content like Apps, Workflows and Documentation, along with Blogposts, videos and who do support and github contributions.

We will share 5% of our revenue in the calendar year of 2023.

## FAQ

Our goal with Shuffle as a platform is to help you earn and get reach for your workflows and apps, along with other content, such as Blogs, Articles, and Videos. The normal starting point is with building Workflows and Apps, then releasing them.
