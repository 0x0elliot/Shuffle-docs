## Introduction
With the introduction of version 0.9.0 of Shuffle, we [Liquid formatting](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) was implemented. Liquid is a templating language, allowing you to perform a lot of useful formatting operations. Common usecases involve directly writing python code or using their Liquids filters to do commong things like Regex Replace and check size. 

Shuffle uses the Python library [Liquidpy](https://github.com/pwwang/liquidpy). If you find something that should work in Liquid, but doesn't work in Shuffle, [please make an issue](https://github.com/pwwang/liquidpy/issues/new). 

## Availability
Liquid parsing is available in any field **used for execution** in Workflows, except for directly in Execution Arguments. See below.

**Works** non-exhaustive:
- App Parameters
- Conditions
- Workflow Variables
- Execution Variables

Does **NOT** work:
- Node name
- Triggers

## Usage and Issues
Liquid is available to anyone using Shuffle, with any app, in any [action parameter](/docs/workflows#passing_values) field belonging to that action. If it fails to parse, you will get a result back. 

## Shuffle's Implementation of Liquid
The main use of Liquid within Shuffle to format text. We recommend using the "Repeat back to me" action in our "Shuffle Tools" app to test, before moving it into the field of choice once you know your formatting works.

Generally in Liquid you output content using two curly braces e.g. {{ variable }} and perform logic statements by surrounding them in a curly brace percentage sign e.g. {% if statement %}. 

It is further possible to write pure python with data from Shuffle. In the case you want anything to come back to you as a result, you can print it, as seen below. 
```
{% python %}
list = ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
print(",".join(list))
{% endpython %}
```

## Most used
### Get the date for tomorrow 
By adding 86400 seconds to the string "now", before adding a date format, we get the timestamp for tomorrow.

**Expression:**
```
{{ "now" | plus:  86400 | date: "%Y%m%d" }}
```

**Result:**
```
20220117
```
### Create an epoch Unix timestamp 
By using the string "now", and changing the date format to seconds, it will give you the epoch timestamp.

**Expression:**
```
{{ "now" | date: "%s" }}
```

**Result:**
... 
1643912690 
... 

### Get size of an array

**Input:**
```
{{ ["this", "is", "an", "array"] | size }}
```

**Output:**
```
4
```

### Add 10 to each number in a list
First, make another node in Shuffle (e.g. Shuffle Tools 1) with the following data:
```
[{"number": 1}, {"number": 2}, {"number": 3}]
``` 

In our second node (e.g. Shuffle Tools 2), we're building out a JSON object, and want to add 1 to each item of this list, setting them to the key "new_number".
```
{"new_number": {{ $shuffle_tools_5.#.number | plus:  1 }} }
```

Want to merge the data in both of these lists? Use the "Merge lists" action, and add both lists to the 

### Dot notation
In [certain cases](https://github.com/Shuffle/Shuffle/issues/848), you may get JSON that has invalid keys. In these cases, we have workarounds using python to get the information. Here's an example based on an older issue someone had:

A node with the name "nodename" has the following value:
```
{"_source": {"kibana.alert.rule.name": "Agent Spoofing - Multiple Hosts Using Same Agent", "siem.thresholdRule", "kibana.alert.rule.uuid": "abcde12345"}}
```

How would you get the field "._source.agent.alert.rule.name" within Shuffle? The answer is a workaround that utilizes Python, where you can work around dot notations with Python's bracket syntax.
```
{% python %}import json; print(json.loads($nodename)["_source"]["kibana.alert.rule.name"]){% endpython %}
```

Keep in mind this is not optimal nor an intended solution in many other scenarios. Just when keys are not represented in a useful way.

### Data cleaning - newlines and quotes
As quotes can't be part of text in JSON, you may need to clean up data a whole lot before sending it on to it's destination. To do this, we use filters to remove bad data. First, make another node in Shuffle (e.g. Shuffle_Tools_1 with the following data repeated in the "Repeat back to me" action:
```
`Investigation

• Headline- Multiple inbound requests from foreign Ips related to IOCs log4shell

• Summary of Findings: Defense has observed 123 logs from the past 30 days with 25 potential malicious IP addresses linked to the Log4J exploit. Those malicious IP’s were generated from inbound requests to trusted host "123.222.154.200". Defense also noticed internal to potentially malicious external IP traffic over port 443 from IP addresses 10.20.30.40. Attached is a Excel document with the list of the raw data, source IP’s, Destination IP’s and Malicious IP’s .
```

Now make a second node (also repeat back to me), which 
```
{
"fields": {
       "project":
       {
          "key": "TTPJ"
       },
       "summary": "test",
       "description": "description": "{{ '$shuffle_tools_1' | newline_to_br | replace: '"', '' | replace: "<br />", "\\n" }}",
       "issuetype": {
          "name": "Task"
       }
   }
}
```

The JSON should now be valid, even with newlines. You can use replace and other newline replacements in the same way.


### Check if time now is between 4:30 PM and 8 AM EST
A script that returns False if the time now is NOT between the times assigned, and True if it IS between those times. 

Prints are sent to the Shuffle frontend. Needs to start with {% python %} and end with {% endpython %}

```
{% python %}
import datetime

initial_timestamp = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc) - datetime.timedelta(hours=5)
timedata = {
    "now": initial_timestamp.strftime("%s"),
    "comparison": "",
    "run_alert": False,
}
midnight = datetime.datetime.combine(
    datetime.date.today(),
    datetime.time(0, 0)
)
if initial_timestamp.hour < 8 and initial_timestamp.hour >= 0:
    tomorrowtime = (midnight + datetime.timedelta(hours=8)).strftime("%s")
    timedata["comparison"] = tomorrowtime
    if timedata["now"] < tomorrowtime:
        timedata["run_alert"] = True
elif initial_timestamp.hour >= 16 and initial_timestamp.hour <= 23:
    todaytime = (midnight + datetime.timedelta(hours=16, minutes=30)).strftime("%s")
    timedata["comparison"] = todaytime
    if timedata["now"] > todaytime:
        timedata["run_alert"] = True

print(timedata["run_alert"])
{% endpython %}
```

## Filter Usage
Below is a list of example usage in Shuffle.

### Join
Join takes a list, and outputs the list, joined by the string specified.

Input:
```
{{ ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"] | join: ", " }}
```

Output:
```
tag1, tag2, tag3
```

### Example use of Liquid in a Shuffle workflow 

1. Loading up a list of IP's stored in a file uploaded to Shuffle.

![Overview of the workflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31187099/147345617-d9877652-161e-48f2-94d4-97c4e92e073a.png "Overview of the workflow")

2. The list is loaded up but the whitespace starting up the list will cause parsing problems while trying to use the list.

![Image showing a list of IPs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31187099/147345630-ccd6dfcc-61a0-4c48-9fb5-f14293347fe3.png "List of IPs")

3. So we employ the use of liquid formatting to clean up the list and then use it in our workflow, in our case its just a basic strip and everything is ready for use

![App actions window with applied liquid formatting in the "Items" field of the parse list function in the Shuffle Tools app](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31187099/147345651-608e7020-6407-40c5-b959-68583d894b67.png "App actions view")

4. We then continue an error free session with a clean list, utilizing it in our workflow

![Successfully parsed list of IP adresses](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31187099/147345723-05731f54-1d1a-43b8-bfe9-79ee1a7c9c3c.png "Parsed IPs")

### Example use of Liquid in a Shuffle workflow

* When trying to reverse a JSON list using using Liquid formatting we get an error due to problems with the Liquid library in use. Take this JSON as an example,

[
    {
        "Key": "2",
        "A": "B"
    },
    {
        "Key": "1",
        "A": "B"
    }
]
* If we try to reverse this array via the normal reverse function in Liquid we get the error shown below.
[{{ $shuffle_tools_1 | reverse}}] 

Error gotten: 
[<list_reverseiterator object at 0x3eb14f722f70>]

* Getting creative we find a work around for this by incorporating the join function in Liquid, so your call would ideally look like this. [{{ $shuffle_tools_1 | reverse | join: ',' }}]. As you can see from the below screenshot this works perfectly getting a work around for using Liquid's reverse function.
