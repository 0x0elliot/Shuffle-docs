# Customer Tracking and Sales view in Github

URL: https://github.com/orgs/Shuffle/projects/7

In Github there is a customer-tracking board that contains two views. One for tracking against technical work that needs to get done.

There is also a sales view that has been created separate for tracking against sales.

New items can be created on this board. Please ensure to fill out all of the necessary information such as a descriptive title, priority, customer name, due date, assignee, and appropriate label. If you click on the title, you may also place a note on the ticket as well. The screenshot below shows a reference of the two views.
