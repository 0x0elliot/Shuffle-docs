# Communication
We're an all-remote company that allows people to work from almost anywhere in the world. We are and will hire great people regardless of where they live. With this in mind, it's important for us to practice clear communication in ways that help us stay connected and work more efficiently.

## Asynchronous 
To accomplish more as a remote company, we use asynchronous communication as a starting point and stay as open and transparent as we can by communicating through public issues, merge requests, and Discord.

We also place an emphasis on ensuring that conclusions of offline conversations are written down. When we go back and forth three times, we jump on a synchronous video call.

Embracing asynchronous communication and learning to use it effectively requires a mental shift. This can feel unusual or even uncomfortable for those who come from a colocated environment, where in-person meetings and communiques are the norm. Learn more about mastering the use of the written word in an all-remote setting.

## Documentation
In every case where you're working on something someone else may have a need for, it should be documented. Documentation in Shuffle is the primary communication and scale-enabler, and is done, either on Github, or in Google docs. 

This pertains to all roles. 

## Meetings
We try to avoid meetings unless necessary, but will as described in the introduction, have them to handle discussions that take multiple back-and-forths. A focus on clear and concise written communication is always preferred first.

In certain cases, meetings may not be avoided. If so, invite the other person to a call on [Google meet](https://meet.google.com/).

## Internal communication
Internal communication is handled primary on [Discord](https://discord.gg/B2CBzUm). As you come on board the Shuffle team, we will give you rights to read our internal communication channels, and over time, give you moderator rights. In one-on-one cases, use direct messages, along with email to get your point across.

More about how we use [Discord for moderation](https://github.com/Shuffle/Shuffle-docs/blob/master/handbook/communication/discord_support.md). 

## External Communication
External communication most of the time takes place in emails and meetings. While we're small, please feel free to use the tool of your liking. 

## Questions
If you have questions, use the internal Whatsapp group or anyone on our team through Discord. 

## Extra
We believe Gitlab is doing the best in the world at remote work and culture. Here are their guidelines, which very well fits with how we at Shuffle should communicate as well.

### Effective & Responsible Communication Guidelines
* **Assume Positive Intent**. Always begin with a position of positivity and grace.
* **Kindness Matters**. You are looking at a screen, but you are really talking to a person. If you wouldn't say it to a person's face, don't send it to them in a text message.
* **Express Your Thoughts**. We live in different locations and often have very different perspectives. We want to know your thoughts, opinions, and feelings on things.
* **Own It**. If you say it or type it, own it. If it hurts the company or an individual, even unintentionally, we encourage you to look at things from other points of view and apologize easily.
* **Be a Role Model of our Values**.
* **Feedback is Essential**. It is difficult to know what is appropriate in every one of our team members 60+ countries. We encourage team members to give feedback and receive feedback in a considerate way.
* **Don't Underestimate a 1:1**. Asynchronous communication (e.g., via text) is helpful and necessary. In some cases (e.g., to clarify misunderstandings) it can be much more effective to jump on a Zoom video call.
* **Focus on what we can directly influence**. There are many factors we can't directly influence and we should avoid spending time discussing those things. For example, we don't talk about our market capitalization because aspects of this are out of our control. Instead, we should focus on our KPIs and growing annual recurring revenue.
* Everyone should be comfortable in their work environment.
