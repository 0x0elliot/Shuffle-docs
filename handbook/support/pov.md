# PoV
This file outlines the basic process of how we do free PoV's with a potential customer from start to finish. 

### Goal
The goal of a PoV is to ensure Shuffle helps the customer with their requirements for automation.

### Length
A typical PoV lasts a maximum of 3 months, but can be done as soon as the contractual requirements are done, meaning we have an incentive to help them as much as possible, as fast as possible.

### Outline
- Onprem / Cloud
- Make sure Apps are supported
- 3 Workflows of their choosing
- estimated scale needs (per asset/per ticket)

## Process
1. Get to PoV:
  - Create a Google Drive folder to contain documents
  - Add them to the CRM
  - Have introduction call(s) to figure out their needs (apps, workflows, onprem/cloud)
  - ensure they understand 
2. Before technical call:
  - Make a document in their Google Drive to document PoV progress and their needs
  - Check if we have a working version of all apps
  - Check if we have workflows to match their usecases 
  - Check other usecases that they may have not thought about
3. Start implementation 
  - Set up regular calls (if applicable)
  - ensure all apps can: Connect & Authenticate
  - ensure we understand the necessary actions for each app
