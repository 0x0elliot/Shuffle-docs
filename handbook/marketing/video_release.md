# Video release
This document outlines the release creation process of videos to be used for social media and documentation

TBD: Who does what when? Editing? QA? Recording? Releases?

## Creation
- Figure out [what to make](https://github.com/infopercept/projects) 
- Figure out the way to make and record it
- Build an example workflow, including with comments

## Editing
- Write a script
- Speak over it
- Mash it together :)

## Release
- Make sure to:
* Add the video to PUBLIC documentation for the same thing
* Write text that fits for social media platforms
* Release on Twitter, Linkedin & Discord announcement
* Release a workflow publicly from the X account?
* Make sure to have further reading -> E.g. pointing to larger videos, blogs or documentation that utilizes the same function
