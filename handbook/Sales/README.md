## Introduction

This Sales Process Document has been developed for use in Shuffle's
Sales efforts. As a startup, Shuffle AS has begun the formal process of
sales. Sales has been identified as a key area of improvement by
Shuffle's executive leadership. This process will allow Shuffle to
identify potential Partners and add users. The sales need by
implementing a repeatable and standardized sales process with
participation more effectively.

## Explanation of Business Process Document

Business Processes are effective ways to improve business performance,
increase workforce and resource efficiencies, and perform value-added
functions to meet critical needs. To be effective, a business process
should also be easily integrated with other processes and the
organizational structure. As potentially useful and effective as
business processes are, often they're poorly planned, implemented, or
communicated. In such cases, a process may result in confusion and
create an even more ineffective environment than previously existed.
When planning, implementing, and communicating a new business process,
it is important to provide structure, a formal process flow, process
boundaries, inputs/outputs, and control points. This will allow the
organization to not only achieve improved performance, but to have a
mechanism to continually improve the business process.

**Process Purpose:** This section provides a description of the purpose
of the process. This includes why and how the process will benefit the
organization.

**Process Scope**: This section should provide a description of what is
included in the business process as well as what is not included or is
out of scope for the process.

**Process Input**: All business processes have an input or a need to be
fulfilled. This need or input is what initiates the process to begin.
This section should identify the need or input required to initiate the
process.

**Process Boundaries**: Process boundaries are a way of identifying
where a process begins and where it ends. For example, there may be a
need or input that initiates a process but is not actually a part of the
process. The boundaries of the process must be clearly defined,
documented, and communicated.

**Process Flow:** Many business process documents provide the process
flow in a graphical format. Some provide the flow in a verbal format.
Some provide both. This may depend on organizational standards. However,
it is imperative that some detailed description of the flow of the
process is provided. Without this, the process becomes open to
interpretation and will suffer from a lack of formality and clarity.
This section should describe each step of the process from beginning to
end.

**Process output:** All business processes have an output or result that
they must achieve. This is directly tied to the process purpose. While
the output may not necessarily be a formal part of the process
itself---depending on where the boundary is established---it is an
integral part of the document as it explains what it expected upon
completion of the process. This section should provide an explanation of
the process's output.

**Exceptions to Normal Process Flow:** Often, a business process will
not follow its normal workflow from beginning to end as there may be
many variables involved in the process. This section should explain
where exceptions to the flow may occur and what steps will be taken in
such an instance.

**Control Points and Measurements:** Business processes are not without
risk and uncertainty. Nor are they exempt from any type of efforts to
continuously monitor and improve them. Control points should be
established at various points of the process flow where risks have been
identified. This helps the process owner monitor risks associated with
the process and is useful in ongoing process improvement efforts.
Measurements are also necessary for determining the effectiveness of a
process and performing process improvement. Measurements may coincide
with control points to identify where risks or problems may reside and
to determine a methodology for improving the process around these risks
and problems.

            -   If the LinkedIn is found, use Leadjet to automatically
                > input the Lead into the CRM

        -   If the email's owner is impossible to identify or it is a
            > fake email, do not integrate into Copper but still add
            > them to the newsletter

### 

### 

### Lead Research

-   -   If the LinkedIn of the Lead is not easily found, add them as a
        > contact on an Outlook account linked to your LinkedIn and view
        > their contact information to find if a LinkedIn profile using
        > that email exists

    -   Otherwise, search for the email on Google and try to find
        > relevant data to identify the email owner and then check if
        > they have a Linkedin profile

-   Based on Job Position/Title, add tag to Copper profile for easier
    > filtering and approach method

    -   Add "decision maker" tag if the Job Position has to do with
        > having a say in what software the company/project can use i.e.
        > CEO, Director, etc.

    -   Add "free user" tag for other Job Position i.e. Engineer,
        > Developer, etc.

### 

### Analyze Needs

-   Use information from Linkedin to provide a Shuffle solution that is
    > relevant to the Lead's Job Position and to create a more
    > attention-grabbing conversation

    -   Additionally, you can use Drift + Algolia + Google Analytics to
        > identify what a Lead is doing on our website for further
        > insight. See Analytics.

### 

### Outreach

1.  Check shuffler.io email and drift email tracking notifications for
    > new responses to previously sent emails.

2.  Reach out to new Leads via email

    -   Subject of email should include First Name/Company and end with
        > a "?"

    -   Goal is to schedule a meeting/demo for customer conversion but
        > content of email differs between "decision makers"/"MSSP" and
        > "free users"

        -   Decision Makers basic example: Hey (Name), My name is
            > (Name). Just reaching out to see if you had any questions
            > getting started with (workflow). We offer a free
            > Proof-of-Value so let\'s set up a quick call to discuss
            > further.

        -   Free Users basic example: Hey (Name), Thank you for using
            > Shuffle! If you need help, we highly recommend you to join
            > our Discord community if you haven\'t already. If you're
            > looking for a personal support service or would like to
            > subscribe, we can also arrange a call to help you (fix
            > scenario)"

1.  Reach out to new Leads via LinkedIn

    -   This method should be used if a LinkedIn account can be found
        > for the Lead, especially if a current/working email cannot be
        > found.

    -   Try to connect with every Lead

    -   -   When sending an invitation to connect:

            -   Select "Other" for "How do you know each other?"

            -   Add a note to the invitation that says:

> using the platform.

    > tech team member into a group chat on LinkedIn in order to make
    > transition into a demo smoother

### Demo
