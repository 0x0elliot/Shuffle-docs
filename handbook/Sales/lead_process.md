This is a defintion documentation for what the different levels of the sales process are. They typically go as follows:

1. Contacted
2. Lead
3. POV
4. Customer

Each section below describes these better

## 1. Contacted
Someone who tried out Shuffle, who we reached out to. We get ~10 of these a day [updated in the stats](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-nHOAtAq-5pqaSwjlAmSvG4LxoazCxZViYkf10jnPFA/edit#gid=2026695909) 
document, and if we reach out to them, they should be set to contacted.

If they reach out to us, go to the next stage (lead)

## 2. Lead
A lead is anyone who is confirmed to be interested in Shuffle. They could reach out through Drift, our support chat or be a reply to one of our emails from the previous step. 

This needs to be manually set in most cases.

## 3. POV
Someone who has the intent of buying a license for Shuffle, whether cloud or onprem. This means they should get the same treatment as a customer, as the goal is converting them to one. 

**Contracts should be signed before this is done.
**

## 4. Customer
A customer is someone who has signed and paid for Shuffle. Full stop.


## Partner
TBD
