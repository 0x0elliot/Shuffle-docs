# 1. Onboarding
Here, we will take care of all general on-boarding tasks. Here is a list of actions that will take place:
* Service agreement signed/reviewed
* Shuffle or the Customer will prepare the initial cloud organization and give all the required access rights to the customer
* The customer provides Shuffle with a list of tools and services in use, along with basic automation priorities

# 2. In-depth scoping
The Account Executive and TAM will coordinate a call with technical resources on the customer side. On the call, we will cover all the technical details relevant to the project such as, but not limited to:

* Tools in use based on our automation & detection framework
* Access rights to these tools
* What services are most critical to automate first
* An overview of the customers’ infrastructure
* Expected scale of operations
* Oauth Application creations
* Single Sign-On
* Access to the Shuffle console
* Hybrid configuration
* Security Policies
* Integration meeting schedules
* Unique configurations within the environment

Please note that this list is only a guide, other scoping elements will be included per your specific requirements. We ask that the customer ensure all relevant technical resources are available for this meeting to ensure a thorough scope is attained. 


# 3. Integration Phase
The TAM and engineers assigned to the project from Shuffle will begin the integration and implementation as per the scope. They will be following a detailed plan formulated from the scoping sessions, including expected timestamps for each of the deliverables. The steps are typically as follows, but may vary:

* Set up the required on-premises and cloud access and infrastructure for the customer
* Configure required proxies, scalability, hybrid access, etc. 
* Work with customer to set up and authenticate specified tools within Shuffle
* Build initial Workflow(s) for the discussed use-cases. Starts with inbound information in most cases, e.g. from a SIEM or Email to Shuffle.
* Further tune the Workflow(s) to best fit the customer’s environment

These steps typically take 4-6 weeks, depending on the complexity of the customer’s environment.


# 4. Operations
The customer can expect meetings every other week or every month to ensure Shuffle works to their satisfaction, as well as to further scope next steps. These meetings may be with the AE, TAM and engineers working on the project. Further steps may involve, but is not limited to:

Custom app development
Further environment and scale configurations
Further Use-case creations
Add extra Shuffle environments
Hands-on training
Automation Collaborations
Detection Engineering improvements
