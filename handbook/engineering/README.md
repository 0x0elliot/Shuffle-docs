# Engineering
The Engineering folder is for those working on technical tasks in Shuffle. 

## Roles
1. **Automation/Security Engineers:** The main role of automation engineers is to support customer growth and solve usecases for customers and community members.
2. **Developers:** The main role of Shuffle developers is to support customer growth and make the platform easier to use.

## Find tasks to do
1. A quick way to search for ALL tasks assigned to you is to open [search](https://github.com/search) and enter this: `` is:open is:issue org:Shuffle assignee:USERNAME ``.

2. To find specific tasks:
- Open a specific  Github Project (probably [Shuffle Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Shuffle/projects/8)). 
-  Open a specific tab, say ``v1.4.0`` in [Shuffle Roadmap - v1.4.0](https://github.com/orgs/Shuffle/projects/8/views/48).
- In the filter-search bar, add a filter for your name by adding ``assignee:USERNAME``.
- Now you have all your tasks in front of you. Start working on them!
- If you want to filter more and prioritize your tasks, you can add more filters in the filter-search bar such as priority, milestone, label, etc.

3. All tasks are present in these Github Projects (not in order, and focus on highest priority):
  - Public: [Shuffle Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Shuffle/projects/8)
  - Private: [GCP & Cloud Tasks](https://github.com/orgs/Shuffle/projects/4/views/7)
  - Private: [Usecase Tracking](https://github.com/orgs/Shuffle/projects/7/views/7)
  - Public: [Shuffle Apps](https://github.com/Shuffle/python-apps)
  - Public: [Documentation](https://github.com/Shuffle/shuffle-docs)
