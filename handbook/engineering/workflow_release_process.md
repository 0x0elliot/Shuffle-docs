# Workflow Release process

# Introduction

Creating an idea from scratch can be hectic at times, but it gets easier with a well formulated roadmap to attain whatever you intend. Different people employ the use of different tools and technologies daily to achieve somewhat similar results, similar case applies to Shuffle users. We intend in creating this structured process as a skeleton for you to build up on, from the moment an idea hits you to putting that idea into production in your own environment and even sharing it publicly.

## Overview

At Shuffle, we have grouped usecases into 5 main types, see [usecases](https://shuffler.io/usecases);
* Collect
* Enrich
* Detect
* Respond
* Verify


### Example 1:
Employees will be forwarding suspected phishing emails that hits their inbox or spam folder into a central company email for further analysis by the security team, and a reply forwarded to the employee who flagged the email as to whether the suspected phishing email was indeed a phishing email or not. 

### Example 2:
We need to know and constantly be aware about what information can the world see and get about our publicly facing assets, get a notification if there is any new information i.e a new open port e.t.c 

We'll be using example 1 and example 2 above to easily elaborate the whole processes
