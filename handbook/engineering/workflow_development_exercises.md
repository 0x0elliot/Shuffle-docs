# Workflow development exercises 
This document contains exercises for learning to use the various kinds of tools of Shuffle. The goal is NOT to learn about the platforms we use for our examples, but instead of learn about the various techniques used in Shuffle, making you proficient in workflow building and troubleshooting.

**Read documentation carefully, but think critically** 

## Introduction
Please start by following these documents:
- [See our getting started section](https://shuffler.io/docs/getting_started)
- [introductory tutorial on Medium](https://medium.com/shuffle-automation/introducing-shuffle-an-open-source-soar-platform-part-1-58a529de7d12) 
- Reading the [Workflow documentation](http://shuffler.io/docs/workflows).

4. Nestedloops
5. Start node
6. Triggers
7. [Liquid formatting]([url](https://shuffler.io/workflows/0d604c52-1b3f-49d8-a57e-480baf07ab8d))
8. Subflows
9. [Shuffle Cache]([url](https://shuffler.io/workflows/f39a3c37-4f38-4ca0-952a-a9425080b44e))
10. [Shuffle File storage]([url](https://shuffler.io/workflows/dd5e3800-2f2e-4089-8055-b500e3b8b349)) 
11. App Authentication
12. Loop filtering

## Use-case exercises
To learn about how to do common things with Shuffle, we suggest trying to make the following use-cases.

### 1. Communication: Email!
The goal of this workflow is to get emails, and analyze whether the sender's IP is malicious, and adding it to Shuffle cache for whether it's analyzed. 

1. (App auth) 					Make a Workflow that gets your new emails, and marks them as read. Use either Gmail, Outlook, the Email app OR any of the email triggers.
2. (Variables) 					From the same emails, parse out indicators of compromise (IoC's)
3. (Filtering & Search) Parse out any IPs and run a GreyNoise community search for whether they're malicious IF 
4. (Shuffle Cache) 			If it's found to be malicious, add it to the cache list "malicious_ips", otherwise add it to "benign_ips"

- Schedules, Whois

### 2. Cases: Issue management with Jira 
The point of this usecase is to learn to filter and problem solve typical API problems using files and loops

1. (Signup) Make a user on Jira here: [Jira download](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira?&aceid=&adposition=&adgroup=95003655569&campaign=9124878867&creative=415542762940&device=c&keyword=jira%20software%20sign%20up&matchtype=e&network=g&placement=&ds_kids=p51242194601&ds_e=GOOGLE&ds_eid=700000001558501&ds_e1=GOOGLE&gclid=CjwKCAiA5t-OBhByEiwAhR-hmx8BfX8_S0SEAnN5pj0Lka1qmQ7G0-IqZOrwkL3JZYe_Rxp1i3RwBRoCLuwQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
2. (App Auth) Use Shuffle to create a issue with the title "This is a test issue for handling malware"
3. (Files) Use the file system in Shuffle to create AND upload the Eicar test file to the same issue: https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt
4. (Problem & Filter Loop) List ALL issues (NOT JUST ONE) on your Jira account. Filter to look for whether they have attachments in them using Shuffle tools.
5. (Filter Loop) Based on the previous issues with attachments, find THE issue that you just made in step 2.
6. (Files) With the issue availabe, re-download the file to Shuffle.

### 3. Intel: Continuous analysis for changes
The point of this workflow is to make a list of indicators, and searching for if their data changes.

1. (Files) Make a file with 5 IPs inside of it, then upload it to Shuffle 					
2. (Liquid) Parse the file into a JSON list within Shuffle, making it usable 				
3. (Cache & Schedule) Use [IPInfo](https://ipinfo.io/signup) to analyze them every 30 minutes 	
4. (Filter & Notify) If the data changes between those 30 minutes, send yourself an email notifying you. 

PS: You can test whether it changed by setting the value manually in the next iteration.

### 4. SIEM: Run a search in Logz.io and add IP to list
The point of this exercise is to use a SIEM to create a threat list, and alert on matches.

PS: Add process for uploading logs

1. (Signup) [Sign up to Logz.io](https://logz.io/freetrial-bd/)
2. (App Auth) Using the API, create a threat list within Logz.io 
3. (Loop & Schedule) Create a rule for that threat list in the UI itself. Continuously look for alerts in Logz.io with the API and a schedule. 
4. (Loop) Take a list of 5 IPs, and add them to the threat list in Logz.io 
5. (Delete & Overwrite) Modify the threat list with 5 new IPs.
6. (Webhook trigger) Modify the rule in step #4 using the API (not manual), having it send notifications to a Shuffle Webhook 

### 5. Networking: Block IP based on user input
PS: Do #4 first. 

From #4, WHEN an alert is found from a Webhook, ALSO block that IP in Amazon AWS s3 AND Amazon AWS VPC where the server is if a user wants it based on SMS or Email (?).

### 6. Eradication: Run a script on a host
With Wazuh/Logz.io, we want to run a script on a host to block all incoming network traffic and stop a service from running

### 7. Asset Management: Find asset, and ask their owner whether you can auto-patch it in the background in an Email 


### 8. Identity Access Management: Add user, block them from accessing, and export data as CSV
Sign up to Okta, then use API's to to sign up another user, block their access, and export a report (create) in CSV format, which we upload to a different platform for customer reporting.

1. (Signup) [Sign up to Okta](https://www.okta.com/uk/free-trial/) for a trial * If you have problems signing up with your organization / this domain is already taken error, just add a couple of strings in the alloted space after your company's domain name and you should be good to go. 
2. (App Auth) Make another user in your tenant using their API
3. (Variables) Block that same users' account using the API
4. (Loop) Make a CSV export of general user info: Id, Name, Account Status, Times logged in, Last login
5. (Mail) Send this CSV to yourself as an attachment to an email on a schedule every 1. of the month

### 9. De-duplication, Conditions, lists and loops and Subflows.
